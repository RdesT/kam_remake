Beta r13570

Fixes
- memory which was used to load Units.rxa textures was not deallocated. Saved ~500Mb of RAM. It should highly reduce number of Out of Memory errors
- several other minor memory leaks
- units hitboxes were not correct on r13380
- bug with some game commands could be executed even after player disconnection
- game crash when press Alt with opened F11 menu or click on KMR icon in the top-left corner
- game speed was not reset to default (PT/afterPT) for loaded MP game with 2 or more players, while it had 1 player and changed game speed when saved
- it was possible to select wrong group when click in the game message log (f.e. unit group is hungry)
- do not allow beacon cursor over game stats screen
- message buttons could sometimes overlap one over other (message log and single message icons)
- script action HouseTakeWaresFrom could crash the game because of interaction with takeOut delivery mode
- add MemUsed and StackUsed sections to perflog to track RAM usage
- add options to make whole map screenshot on the 'F11->game advanced' panel: max image size and image type

MapEd:
- fixed elevation brushes and other issues related to wrong cursor position over terrain with height > 100
- show actual terrain height az Z coordinate, even in 'flat terrain' mode
- fix for terrain brushes were not canceled properly on RMB
- fix terrain flip was not correct for some special tiles (f.e. walls)
- rename map type 'tactic' to 'fighting' and 'normal' to 'building', same as we use on other menus

Terrain tiles:
- refactoring of how we store tiles data. Use data/defines/tiles.json with all tiles parameters instead of pattern.dat and hardcoded data. Its much easier to make moddable animation or set any tile parameters now
- add ice animation for tiles 264 and 265
- fix for waterfalls and some other animations with 2 layers (f.e. tile 196 with water plant)

Campaigns:
- delete 'KamStar Beginning' campaign on author request
