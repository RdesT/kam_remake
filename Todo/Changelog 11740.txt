Advanced AI: 
- updated AI parametrisation after ~500k game runs.
- fixed several bugs

Bug fixes:

Scripting: 
- Replaced debug executor by standart executor by default. Debug executor is extremely slow (at least 3 times slower). Debug exec could be turned on in F11 menu to get exact error (execution time) positions in the scripts

Misc:
- added fixes for snow houses, made by @thunder
- updated Overbyte network framework to version 8.63
- disable async game resource load. It's provem to be unstable (could be a cause of errors on map load). Still could be enabled by setting in the settings.ini
- added F2 hotkey in the menu to rename map or replay


MapEd: 
- added 240 tiles for 3 terrain kinds transitions, made by @andreus
- added missing controls from tiles submenu page on palette. Added hotkeys on palette
