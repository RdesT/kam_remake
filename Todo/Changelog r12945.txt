Game:
- woodcutter's house: reverse cycle of woodcutter mode when right click on the woodcutter mode button

Fixes:
- it was not possible to transfer maps with an empty script file in the lobby, f.e. RMG map
- autosaves or saves could cause crash in some cases
- MP game with 1 human player should toggle back to 'lobby' game speed, when press F5-F8 keys
- MapEd copy-paste feature could crash when pasting big copied area onto small map
- MapEd: terrain walk connect was not updated in the editor, which causes f.e. missing mining radiuses for fisherhuts
