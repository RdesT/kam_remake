[9:53 PM]Rey: Notes for the latest version r10540:

2 debug options added were to settings.ini, enabled by default

- SaveRandomChecks - save all random checks that game made during execution. They will be saved in .rng file in save directory. 
Its better to turn this option off if you want to play extremely long game, more then 3 hours long - set it to 0 in the KaMRemake_settings.ini

- SaveGameAsText - allows to save game data in text form, good for debug, saved in .sav.txt file in save folder

Those files (.rng and .sav.txt) will be attached to crashreport or any save.
In case you have problems (f.e. game freeze too much on autosave) you can turn those options off (set them to 0)
