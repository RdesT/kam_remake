KaM Remake r5503 [2013.06.23]
----------------------------------------
Fixes:
 +  Make Serfs face the house plan entrance when handing building materials to it
 +  Stonemasons/fishermen would report that resources are depleted when the only mining spots were blocked by another unit
 +  Archers behave badly when you tell them to attack directly (houses and units)
 +  Saving a game or a map in MapEd with a name ending/starting in a space crashes with "Invalid file name"
 +  In maps with elevated terrain near the top it is not possible to see units standing on the top few rows
 +  MapEd did not saved Group orders (sendGroup and AttackPosition)
 +  Only the first 16 servers would be queried correctly, subsequent servers would not show in the list
 +  Chasing down archers even with knights is ineffective, knight starts to attack and archers keep stepping away, then the knight stops and just stands there
 +  If you halt your archers after they shoot they will shoot without reloading, increasing their firing speed
 +  Game window would move when resizing below minimum allowed size (should stay in place)
 +  If weapon maker had f.e. 5 axes and 5 lances in output and all weapons were ordered, he would not make bows
 +  Farms were significantly less efficient when sharing a large field between multiple farms
 +  Map/save/replay lists are populated a lot faster now
 +  Citizens graph no longer counts recruits
 +  Better understanding of coop missions in lobby (don't require user to set teams and AI players, don't reveal map in preview, etc.)
 +  Replays would mismatch if a player attempted to use a storehouse cheat pattern (the cheat was allowed in the replay causing a mismatch)
 +  Listbox scrollbars jump when trying to drag them by upper/lower thumb edge
 +  AI attack scripts carried uninitialized values (e.g. delay) over from previous attacks
 +  Limit chat message to some sane amount of characters (256) to avoid spam
 +  Clicking on the splash screen registers the click on the main menu once it is loaded
 +  XML status output from the server sometimes contained invalid characters in player names (now they are escaped correctly)

Improvements:
 +  H  Refactor army management with TGroup layer
 +  L  Allow to set wares count in houses in MapEd
 +  M  FPS shown along side ping so you can easily identify the player causing lag
 +  L  VSync should be configurable on the settings page, it can reduce performance a bit on some systems and players might like to change it
 +  M  Block delivery flags for specific wares in the barracks
 +  L  Wares need to be taken out of the barracks for trading at the market
 +  M  Terrain painting brushes in MapEd
 +  L  Disabling Market buttons will let player know that he can't select new trade without canceling current one
 +  L  Improved stats panel, when possible items are placed one per row 
 +  L  Host can set password for lobby
 +  M  Sliders in lobby for selecting speed during peacetime and after peacetime
 +  L  Army graph starts 5% before the first variation (to skip peacetime)
 +  L  Add a command to let the AI repair houses without building new ones (wasn't possible in KaM)
 +  L  Draw highlight on houses mentioned in an open message
 +    Fix fences shading along edges of FOW
 +  L  Pressing a key selects the map starting with that letter in map/save lists
 +    School+Inn and Quarry+Woodcutters are unlocked in pairs to speedup early game
 +    Made that missions without victory goals do not proclaim player victorious immediately. Instead victory never happens (or ruled by script)
 +  L  Randomize locations within teams option in the lobby
 +  L  Ability to send a whisper (private chat) to a specific player
 +  M  Visualise fog of war for the selected player in replays so you can understand player's perspective
 +  M  Scrolling around the map using middle mouse click, as in TPR
 +  M  Allow host to set a description for the lobby shown on the server selection page ("noobs/pros only", "chat lobby", etc.)
 +  L  Private messaging in MP
 +  L  Add unused sprite 17 from trees.rx
 +  L  Pressing a character with a dropdown/listbox selected will choose the first item starting with that character
 +  L  It is impossible to identify selected group if player flag color is white. Use dark-grey instead.
 +  L  Clicking a location on the lobby minimap selects that location if it's available
 +  L  Minimap preview in lobby could indicate teams somehow as well (border around the color circle?)
 +  L  MapEd: Magic water brush to allow to change waterflow direction on whole area
