Beta r12840

Fixes:
- hotkeys were reset to defaults on game start
- crash, caused by loading kmr_dev.xml file
- bug with "marking text in lobby" and later crash when start game
- crash if TownHall delivery mode was changed to 'Take Out' while serf with gold was entering house
- rare crash while dismissing worker
- crash on a big puzzle-like maps, caused by overflow in Pathfinding algorithm
- crash when Music folder had more then 255 tracks in it
- woodcutter could plant wrong tree type on a few new tiles
- warrior could go there and back between different offenders, if he didn't catch any
- AI got MP setup on game start. It broke AI behaviour on Furious Warriors and other special maps

Campaigns:
- allow to use shared scripts of the campaign, scripts should be placed into the 'Scripts' subfolder of the main campaing folder. Scripts inside mission folder override shared scripts with the same name in the Scripts folder
- allow to use shared audio files in campaigns, they should be placed in the 'Sounds' subfolder of the main campaign folder with XYZ campaign prefix (f.e. TSK.waterfall.ogg). 
A.PlayOgg(0, 'waterfall', 1) in the TSK01.script will try to find TSK01.waterfall.ogg file in the TSK01 mission folder, and if not found it will try to find TSK.waterfall.ogg in the Campaigns\The Shattered Kingdom\Sounds\ folder
