Beta r12864

Fixes:
- it was not possible to load game or replay, if played map had empty script file
- error, caused script preprocessor to add duplicates of event handlers and console commands

Misc:
- houses are allowed to be viewed by ally by default only on locs, where human player could play. So its not possible to view AI only locs by default
- allow to pass -1 as a playerID to Actions.HouseAllowAllyToSelectAll, to apply change to all players
- campaign shared sounds should be placed into Sounds folder inside main campaign folder
- allow to use localized sound files from the scripts, via our standart pattern mission_name.sound_name.locale.extension, applied also to campaign shared sounds

Maps:
- updated coop maps by @andreus, added 2 new coop maps Citadel of Darkness and The Flaming North (changelog: http://bit.ly/andreus-maps-changelog)
- updated @Strangelove's coop maps and The Barbarian King campaign to the latest versions
- added new campaign KamStar Beginning made by @King Dyron
