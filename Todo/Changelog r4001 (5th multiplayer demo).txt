KaM Remake r4179
----------------------------------------
 +  Belarusian letter ÐŽ had upper and lower case swapped in fonts
 +  Intel 965/963 GPU does not comply with OGL 1.5 spec on VBOs, check Assigned instead of OGL version
 +  Taking weapons from store>barracks should not be a lower priority than house>house deliveries
 +  Network latency in KaM Remake was always far higher than necessary due to Nagle's algorithm being enabled by default for TCP (we now use TCP_NODELAY)
 +  A unit should not take a home that he can't walk to
 +  TSK 5 some purple scouts would sit in the top right corner and not attack
 +  Fixed crashes related to TimeGet/GetTickCount overflowing

Improvements:
 +  The map editor shows the number of fish in a water body like other resource deposits
 +  Make hints more visible with background
 +  Number of building materials delivered to an under construction house is shown when it is selected
 +  Holding shift while placing a house keeps the house selected instead of changing to road
 +  Limit number of builders per house, now with MP games having upto 40 builders that is needed a lot
 +  Map editor has speed slider along with size and slope
 +  Marketplace trade values have been significantly changed


KaM Remake r4001 [2012.10.04]
----------------------------------------
Fixes:
 +  Improved units/objects visibility along map edges
 +  Crash if you change locale and don't have OpenAL installed due to using non-blocking Application.MessageBox instead of MessageDlg
 +  Dots and lines displaying on tile edges [Krom]
 +  Producing more than 65k resources causes an integer overflow in PlayerStats
 +  Decreasing the resource distribution removes demands immediately when nobody has taken the task yet
 +  Units now start with the same condition as in TPR (~12 minutes less condition than the last KaM Remake version)
 +  Fix function of the "Restart" button so it always restarts the mission you were playing, not just loads basesave
 +  Fixed crash when units feet were off map bounds
 +  Fixed crash when arrows would be flying outside of map
 +  Fixed crash when watching Credits page for more than 28min
 +  The game should display time played without clipping it to 24hours
 +  Woodcutter should take his axe with him from home when he is going out to chop trees
 +  "Under attack" messages should play when the loc is not visible on your screen, rather than using arbitrary >=30 rule
 +  Farmer should not sow corn on tiles left after demolished houses that were built ontop of roads built ontop of fields 
 +  Placing a house above other players units in MapEd is now handled on mission load (it caused a crash before)
 +  Pressing the "Restart" button during a replay would sometimes cause a crash
 +  Resource harvesting now checks walking length rather than direct distance to stop e.g. woodcutters walking all the way around a mountain/river
 +  Sandhills cause water next to shore tiles to appear darker with square edges
 +  Fixed a crash with the AI retaliating against a threat
 +  TSK 19 crashes due to an AI attack (at 06:38) target being off map
 +  Attacking a house from the bottom right, soldiers will stack up rather than choosing a different free cell (flaws in TKMHouse.InReach)
 +  If a woodcutter plants a tree where you placed a building site, the site gets canceled (very annoying) due to AbandonWalk and conditions for multiple players building on a tile
 +  Duplicate app blocking should happen for multiplayer mode only (including replays) as that's the only cheating we care about
 +  Minimap in MapEd would show group members shifted by 1 tile to south-east
 +  Messages show "MissionString out of range" after save+exit+load repeated twice (due to fMissionFile not being saved)
 +  The map editor no longer removes the terrain data used by Krom's Map Editor, so you can use terrain brushes there after saving with the Remake
 +  Leaders of archers would sometimes not fire after walking, instead they would lock up and stand still
 +  Fixed some crashes/bugs in the Linux dedicated server
 +  You won't get a victory if you defeat enemy towns until after recieving all scripted text messages
 +  Crash when selecting a high refresh rate then selecting a resolution that only supports lower refresh rates
 +  In full screen: press Alt-F4, click no, press Alt-F4 again. This time message box goes under game window.
 +  Players can insert illegal characters (according to fAllowedChars) into edits with copy/paste from another program
 +  Flatten/equalise in the MapEd doesn't seem to work properly (like Krom's editor). Unequalise is ok.
 +  Heights look different on certain systems, see heights.jpg images and dxdiag report (triangulation issue)

Improvements:
 +  High quality alpha-blended shadows for houses
 +  Display charts in game results screens (army, wares count, etc.)
 +  Show the player's name above each group (flag holder) while 'T' key is kept pressed
 +  Non-fatal mission script errors will be shown on start
 +  RXXPacker to make soft shadowed RXX files in 1 click rather than by hand
 +  Multiplayer should have an option to send a flare (beacon) on the minimap to tell allies (or all players) about something.
 +  Allow to assign groups and houses(!) to Ctrl+0..9 keys
 +  Play campaign briefing audio files (and fade music while it plays)
 +  Selecting a map in multiplayer should show columns with name, size, player count, etc. rather than dumb drop down
 +  Display count of raw materials of each separate area in MapEd (as number in the middle)
 +  Alerts on the minimap when a unit/house is under attack
 +  Show peacetime remaining in MP replays
 +  Add PlayerCount and Size columns to MapEd selection menu, as well allow to sort maps there
 +  Edges of messages and other scrolls should be transparent so they look smooth
 +  Clicking RMB in schools queue should cancel units on right
 +  Translation manager should have an option to only show certain languages, e.g. DE translator can select just DE and EN rather than scrolling through all of them
