KaM Remake r6720 [2013.06.23]
----------------------------------------
Fixes:
 +  Actions.GroupOrderSplit returned the original group ID, not the new one
 +  Delivery importance would be ignored in cases where you have more available serfs than available deliveries
 +  Storm attacking soldiers would sometimes pass by enemies instead of stopping to fight them
 +  Citizens would not step out of a house onto a tile which was not road
 +  Wares icons went off by few pixels to the left-top on the wares rows, reverted back
 +  MapEd should not allow to set active player type to nor human nor AI
 +  Script command IsFieldAt checked winefields by mistake (same as IsWineFieldAt)
 +  Script could order to attack allied assets. Check alliance settings when executing attack commands from script
 +  Script would not allow to play WAV files with anything except lower case letters and digits
 +  Random seed should be different before each game
 +  Attacking an animal through script command would crash a game
 +  AIs should retaliate when the arrows are in the air, not while the archer is just aiming
 +  Limit save name length (long names can cause crash)
 +  Fixed winefield bug (MapEd did not save grapes objects)
 +  Scripts should not allow to link players warriors to other players group
 +  In-house enable/disable ware delivery in script worked in reverse
 +  Actions.PlayerWareDistribution did not update house orders, so houses didn't notice that the distribution has changed
 +  Integer overflow in stats caused by counting stone/wood as consumed twice when an incomplete house was destroyed
 +  Crash during delivery if ToHouse was destroyed while the serf was inside FromHouse
 +  Network system messages are now translated
 +  Player alliance towards self is inconsistent, especially in MP and when accessing from script (should be Ally always!)
 +  Block sending chat during reconnection to prevent messages being lost or causing errors (when fMyIndexOnServer is out of date)
 +  Beacons did not render on unrevealed areas
 +  Singleplayer replays ended at the last player command rather than when they were saved (use gic_GameSave in SP too)
 +  Actions.GiveHouse failed when there was a worker building a field or road next to the house
 +  Strange AI behaviour in campaign missions due to AI attack values not carrying over like they do in KaM
 +  AI warriors should attack enemies when they are within 4 tiles, to prevent sneaking into AI village (can be set in MapEd)
 +  Terrain brushes in MapEd erase corn/wine fields (should preserve them)
 +  When citizen walks into a house he should be deselected
 +  Make wood to be delivered first to building sites
 +  Changing game options resets all players' ready status so host can't change at the last moment without player agreement
 +  Hotkeys (0..9) are now stored in multiplayer saves too
 +  Replays show the scripted overlay text for the selected player
 +  Message log is no longer lost when saving in multiplayer, and messages no longer show in replays
 +  Arrows shot over longer distances would be invisible for the last ~10% of their flight (units die when no one appears to be shooting them)
 +  Rare stack overflow with flattening terrain recursively during stone mining near a house (which cannot be elevated) See example stonebug.jpg
 +  Dynamic scripts should not allow to give houses/units to disabled player
 +      Script should not allow to place houses on top of fields
 +  TSK15 - AI does not build because stone is too far away (AI builder was incomplete)
 +  Due to archers being less powerful many campaign missions cannot be won (e.g. first battle in TSK 2, TSK 8)

Improvements:

 +  M  Noticeably improved render performance when there are many houses on the screen

 +  L  Allow to specify localized player names for the missions
 +  L  Game will flash on task bar when new chat message arrives

 +  L  MapEd: Allow custom map sizes
 +  L  Shortcuts for all soldier buttons: , & . to rotate, + & - to add/withdraw lines, X to charge, F for food

 +  L  MapEd and script let you add out wares to houses (e.g. stone to stonemason)
 +  M  New column in load/replays menus: Date/time (stored internally in save format since file modified date is not very trustworthy)
 +  L  Keyboard shortcuts to zoom for people without a scrollwheel (page up/page down)
 +  L  Distribution of wares is viewable during replays
 +  L  Rally point for the barracks
 +  L  Warriors leaving the barracks will form a square formation rather than a long snake like in TSK/TPR
 +  L  Multiplayer spectating
 +  L  MapEd option to enable the AI to retaliate against allies' assets being attacked like they do for themselves
 +  L  Multiplayer in-game player list ordered by teams
