[1:48 PM]Rey: KMR Beta 10k+ r10240

1. Bug fixes
- reported game crashes
- delivery system fixes
- game chat sometimes did not copy from lobby into the game
- UI bugs
- campaign difficulty did save between maps
- reset Players color mode to default for every game
- game freeze on Furious Warriors map for ClassicAI
- mapEd object 71 was considered as "unpassable tile" (object 61)
- reverted warrior orders "attack house" and "storm" improvements, since they are unstable
2. Added collecting debug data, saved in *.rng file. Should help to fix game desyncs. File size could be significant (~15Mb for 1 hour 12 players game), will be removed from release version.
3. Added ability to setup hotkey for spectator statistic panel dropbox.
4. Slight spectator stats panel improvements (separated citizens into 2 stat types, improved game visibility behind stats panel)
