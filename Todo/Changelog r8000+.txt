Fix for occasional serfs deliver stone/timber to constructing houses without roads
Added russian translation and ability to add new translations. New translations could be done with TranslationManager.exe, saved, and then sent to me as *.libx file from data/text/ folder
Minor fixes


[11:43 PM]Rey: KMR Beta 8k+ r8302
Changes since r8228:
1. Rebalanced TownHall units gold prices to 3-3-3-5-10-10
2. Added new Campaign by grayter: On Foreign Lands - Empire Reborn
3. Change tick calculation to real value, so, f.e., old r6720 x3 is equal to r8300 x2 speed. Game is speed itself remains almost the same, but the speed value is now very accurate.
4. Added Russian and Hungarian translations and ability to add new translations. New translations could be done with TranslationManager.exe, saved, and then sent to Rey as .libx file from data/text/ folder. Or you can simply modify your lang.libx file similar to text.eng.libx
BugFixes:
- occasional serfs deliver stone/timber to constructing houses without roads
- replay inconsistency after save
- many other minor fixes

[7:20 PM]Rey: KMR Beta 8k+ r8746
1. Fixed occasional game crash on locale change
2. Scripts: added ability to setup custom event handlers. That will allow to have multiple handlers for the same event, invoked one after another. Order of invokation: 1st is default event handler (OnMissionStart, f.e.), then custom handlers in order of declaration in script.

Having custom handlers will open ability to include ready 3rd party scripts with just 1 line of code (by include directive: {$I anotherfile.script}. No need to merge some parts of it with your main script.

Could be added with custom EVENT directive, f.e.:
{$EVENT evtMissionStart:OnCustomMissionStart}

where 
evtMissionStart - event type identifier ('evt' - prefix, 'MissionStart' - event name)
OnCustomMissionStart - name of script procedure, that will be also invoked on mission start (same as default mission start event handler OnMissionStart)


[4:21 PM]Rey: KMR Beta 8k+ r8754
1. Fixed bug for custom event handlers from r8746, when they did not reloaded from save
2. Added ability to add mission 'difficulty' in MapEd Mission Parameters popup window. If those difficulty level are set there, then player will be able to choose difficulty in the SP menu (only for SP now). 
Then mapmaker/scriptmaker can get this difficulty level via calling new script function 
States.MissionDifficulty
, which return result as TKMMissionDifficulty enumeration.

TKMMissionDifficulty = (mdNone, mdEasy, mdNormal, mdHard);


For maps without difficulty (all current maps) mdNone will return. 

Its not affect game or ai. Its just map/game parameters, that player should set on game start and scriptmaker could get its value and modify map somehow.


[1:59 PM]Rey: KMR Beta 8k+ r8769
1. Fixed reported bug, when game occasionally crash on game save

2. Added ~50 new tiles, mostly transitions from stone, but also new coal and iron tiles with 5 resource per tile
3. Added new brushes for automatic transitions between terrains. It uses masks of 3 types (atm, easy to add more types in future). Its possible to make transitions between up to 4 terrain types. 
Unfortunally its hard to reach quality of transtition of prepainted tile, but sometimes its better then nothing.

5. Fixed old r6720 bug with unit revelation at the his current position happened only on the his next move
6. Enlarge troops direction selector change dir from 15 to 20 pixels (to prevent occasional troops direction change)
7. AI and RMG small fixes

2. Fixed old bug (since r6720) with unit FOW revelation at his current position happened only on his next move
3. House FOW revelation is applied from all house points, not only from its bottom right corner point
4. Improved advanced AI quarries positioning, in attemp to prevent crucial stone depleting
5. Various small bug fixes and improvements (including new AI)
6. Improved serfs delivery: when serf finished one delivery at some house he checks if there is any deliver task from that house and even if there is another serf who is on the way to get that task 1st serf will overtake the task.
Basically it means - if there is some ready product at house then any serf who come inside that house will take something out of it.

Use examples:
For TH units cost add next line to the script:

Where 1.2,1.4 is gold ore/gold price multiplier. 
Please contact me for details if some help is needed
