KaM Remake r3392 [2012.05.14]
----------------------------------------
 +  Range Check Error occurs when a woodcutter considers chopping a tree on the topmost or leftmost edge of the map
 +  Click server A, then quickly click server B. This is incorrectly interpreted as double clicking and you join server B
 +  Units should eat a maximum of 2 food items at the inn
 +  Exporting GUI.rx gives a Range Check Error
 +  Woodcutter would occasionally not cut certain trees
 +  Falling trees sometimes looped back to the first frame of the animation making them appear standing again
 +  Houses from script could be placed at invalid tiles or overlapping, causing duplicate watchertower in TSK 7
 +  The breifing for TPR mission 14 was blank due to an error with loading the last string from a LIB file
 +  Major A* pathfinding mistake from r1220 causing long/inefficient routes to be calculated
 +  On slow computers first-time loading takes >20 seconds, meaning you are kicked from multiplayer games by the server
 +  Fixed crash occurring on replay end
 +  Chat button in multiplayer replay viewer was not properly disabled and upon click caused a crash
 +  See-through hills (lighting flaw)
 +  Server selection highlight in MP menu disappears when sorting by any column
 +  Putting a "/" in a save name causes an error (probably other characters like \ ? | too, we should restrict allowed chars)
 +  Entering text into port/room fields. They should accept only digits
 +  Pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL with a game running caused a "System error code 5" or "call to OS function failed" due to Windows denying accesss to Mouse.CursorPos for a moment
 +  Player count for a room should come from host, not the number of clients the server knows about (count can be wrong due to queriers)
 +  Issue with empty saves names and misused whitespaces
 +  The market should be blocked in the original campaigns/tutorial (maybe have an option to enable it starting at later missions, but it still ruins the balance IMO)
 +  Sometimes render order is wrong, using the X/Y values of the sprite gives bad results in some cases
 +  Fixed assert fail when loading map that has roads placed outside of map bounds

Improvements:
 +  Do not allow to run multiple application instances at once to prevent multiplayer cheating
 +  Display height shapes outlines in MapEd
 +  Master server records information about which maps are played
 +  Switching to fullscreen causes banding if drivers report unsupported refresh rates (add manual refresh rate selector to options) [Maciej]
 +  Maps scan should be done in separate thread to unlock GUI
 +  Roads/field plans should only be visible on you and your allies screen to prevent exploiting (move markups from terrain to player)
 +  Allow listboxes to handle up/down arrows
 +  Add sort indicators to listboxes
 +  Minimap preview in lobby, singleplayer and map editor menus
 +  Placing road/field in MP should put a temp/fake visual markup until the real one can be added to make it appear responsive
 +  Locales list is stored in a file rather than hard coded
 +  Locales have a fallback option for very similar languages (e.g. Slovak uses Czech voices)
 +  Make fishes/watersnake to be more visible in MapEd
 +  High quality alpha-blended shadows for units and trees
 +  Logs older than 14 days are automatically deleted
 +  Minimap preview for saves (store raw color data at the begining of the save so it's fast)
 +  Saves/Replays scan should be done in separate thread to unlock GUI [Maciej]
 +  Saves/Replays can be sorted
 +  Custom in-game messages for fan-made campaigns and missions (could be stored in new custom .libx file for the mission)
 +  Support color tags in text
 +  Colors for chat to highlight player names and whether it is team/all channel
 +  Smarter job assignment to workers
 +  Smarter delivery assignment to serfs
 +  Add support for 1024x600 (1280x720) resolution
 +  Make F8 smooth by speeding up the game clock, rather than processing multiple ticks at once
 +  Now using MadExcept for bug reporting which provides much more detailed error information and simple report sending
 +  Add link to kamremake.com (and email?) from inside the game (e.g. from main menu) so that ppl who got Remake from someplace else still had a clear way to our place
